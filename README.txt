# GUI Application for Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python GUI application for data analysis built using Tkinter. The application allows users to fetch data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), merge datasets, save datasets to CSV files, and visualize data using Matplotlib.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Git installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from (https://git-scm.com/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command:


cd path/to/directory
4. Clone the repository using the following command:
